I have a data leakage in the program. 
This results in the program unable to jump out of the while loop that operates  like a for loop.
I will get the code fixed today or tomorrow. I cannot put my code in a module because my server 
dictates the conversion process you guys are writing. the data from java is in the buffer variable.
The variable must be displayed in the while loop that is operating like a for loop.
